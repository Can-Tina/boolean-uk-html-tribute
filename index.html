      <p>
        Cold, cool, and, collected, Miles Edgeworth once known as the Demon King
        of Prosecutors. However, there is more than meets the eye. He has also
        been shown to be caring and compassionate. In the trial of Will Powers,
        he is shown to realise the truth and help to get the real murderer
        behind bars

      <p>
        Edgeworth is known for his incredible fashion sense. He always wears the 
        most immaculate suits. His everyday suit, pictured below, is visually 
        stunning and class as can be. His first trial suit is also widely regarded 
        as one of the best suits worn by a man.
